<h3 id="general-idea">General Idea</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Technology will always move forward with each innovation. These innovations have both upsides and downsides, and both are important to acknowledge and understand. Technology is designed with a purpose in mind but always has unintended effects as it is impossible to predict every single way an innovation will be used, so we have a responsiblity as consumers to use technology for its intended function and for the good of others and as programmers to guide the technology’s function to benefit others and to be clear on its purpose.
Here, we will explain some common technological innovations that have greatly shaped our world and their beneficial and harmful impacts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="uavs-and-drones">UAVs and Drones</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>UAVs (or unmanned aerial vehicles) are simply vehicles without a human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. The use of a UAV can be split into two categories; civillian and military. While civilian UAVs are used for package deliveries and recreation, military drones are used for scout missions and carrying out offensive strikes on enemy targets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drones are vehicles without a human pilot, crew, or passengers and the term can be used synonymously with UAVs, however drones are usually remote controlled. UAVs may have autonomous abilities, while Drones do not, which means that all drones are UAVs, but not all UAVs are drones. Drones are much more commonly used than UAVs, and have uses such as construction, mining, inspection, emergency management, forestry, jounalism, law enforcement, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Benefits</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Aids with military use, as stated previously, by transporting packages or conducting remote spy missions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can help with search and rescue missions, offering more flexibility with movement and speed, as well as the use of thermal cameras for detection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonly used as a hobby, especially in movie or short-film aerial/cenimatic shots</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disadvantages</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Technical: The drone’s reliability and communication via radio signals make it susceptible to signal interference, which could cause it to lose control and pose a safety hazard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safety concern: drones equipped with a camera can pose the risk of a disruption of privacy, if people used it with malicious intent and captured people without their permission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ethical: Rapid drone development could lead to regulatory issues, causing confusion and potentially legal issues. It is important to keep the balance of drone regulations to keep society calm when it comes to the privacy risk of using drones.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artifical Intelligence is the ability of a computer or robot to perform tasks usually associated with human intelletual processes. Put simply, that means a computer with the ability to think and reason through problems (or at least have the semblance of reasoning). Today’s most famous AI models - such as GPT-3.5, DALL-E, or Bard - are all LLMs (large lanuage models). An LLM works by using deep learning to perform natural language processing tasks on huge datasets. This allows them to mimic human intelligence at high speeds, making AI incredibly useful yet also incredibly threatening to human society.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>AI can:
    <ul>
      <li>Create pictures</li>
      <li>Write essays</li>
      <li>Make functional code</li>
      <li>And much, much, more</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AI development is currently at its fastest pace, especially with OpenAI’s GPTs release just a few weeks ago, and AI tools to help your life anywhere from summarizing lectures to planning your outfits are now all over the internet</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-and-negatives">Benefits and Negatives</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of AI’s immense capabilities, many worry the loss to human society will be greater than the gains it brings us.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>BENEFITS:
    <ul>
      <li>Increased Efficiency and Innovation:
        <ul>
          <li>LLMs can automate tasks across various industries, freeing up human resources for more strategic and creative endeavors. This automation fosters innovation and accelerates productivity, contributing to overall economic growth. This means that human businesses can grow on a huge scale and people can accomplish more with less workers, allowing many projects to be completed effectively.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Global Communication and Language Translation:
        <ul>
          <li>Since LLMs are great at language translation, they’re able to break down language barriers and strengthen communication on a global scale. This promotes international understanding, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas, fostering a more interconnected and globally aware society. Learning languages is made easier, as well as using them, allowing for a better global future.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HARMFUL EFFECTS:
    <ul>
      <li>Job Displacement and Economic Inequality:
        <ul>
          <li>While LLMs enhance efficiency, they likely will lead to major job displacement in sectors where routine language tasks are automated. For example, in the recent writers strike, one of the key points they agreed on was that AI could not be allowed to write scripts for movies. AI can contribute to economic inequality and require a shift in workforce skills. It’s essential we address these challenges and if we continue developing AI, we educate and retrain ourselves to work on better jobs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy and Security Concerns:
        <ul>
          <li>LLMs often require vast amounts of data for training, raising concerns about privacy. Inappropriately handled data may compromise individual privacy, leading to potential misuse or unauthorized access. The data we put into it is a big concern as well, due to the fact that AI only determines its thoughts by the information we feed it. If we feed it a source with lots of bias - like for example all of reddit - the responses we get back will be harmful and often socially unacceptable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

<ul>
  <li>Check your phone’s screentime! How much time have you spent on social media? Were you conscious that you were spending that much time on it? How has it positively or negatively impacted you?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="automated-telephone-trees">Automated Telephone Trees</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Automated telephone trees is a system where it can communicate using fixed voice menus with the caller, who can then respond by pressing buttons on the phone or by verbally responding. The system takes and interprets this input as information and can reroute calls, play another response, log information, and more.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One common example we all know is customer service. We call some business or place and are greeted with an automatic message asking us what we need help with –&gt; we press a button and the system takes that information and moves us to an actual person or another automated message.</li>
    <li>An example of a phone tree is shown below:
<img src="https://cohm.com/wp-content/uploads/Call-Tree-Example-1024x925.jpeg" /></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beneficial effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1: Lowers the workload on employees. A call center like customer service gets a massive number of calls all the time, and it is incredibly inefficient and borderline impossible to have every single person be immediately transferred to a human working at the service center. Furthermore, the person who picks up the call may not be in the department or qualified to deal with the issue. Automated phone trees can prompt the caller for a response (such as what type of issue they are having) and sort the calls so they can be transferred to qualified professionals, and some can even give an automated message with the instructions to fix the problem. As a result, automated phone trees greatly alleviate the burden on employees.</li>
    <li>2: Greater reliability. An automated phone tree does not require manual use, and thus it can accept calls 24/7. While it may not connect the caller to a human, there will (most often) always be an option to leave a voicemail, so later someone will contact you back. This guarantees that every call will be received and read.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harmful effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1: Terrible at handling emergencies. Emergencies require instant attention and information relaying and automatic phone trees fundamentally require time, as it uses automatic messages, call queues, holds, transfers, and more until finally reaching a human. This creates many delays which can worsen the emergency.</li>
    <li>2: Customer dissatisfaction. The phone tree requires the caller to input information, and sometimes this can take a long time as they need to listen to the complete automated voice message, press 1 button, hear another message, press another button, and so on. This can annoy the caller and lead to them simply hanging up. Hold times can also sometimes be long and wait times are a big issue. Furthermore, if the phone tree is set up to have the caller verbally respond to a question, the phone tree might not be able to interpret their response, leading to further dissatisfaction. Lastly, the caller might need to repeat their situation multiple times over and over again and no one wants to do that as it is a waste of time.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>For each of the following technologies, please list 2 beneficial and 2 harmful effects and briefly explain.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Online shopping:</li>
    <li>Cryptocurrency:</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Below are examples of a technological innovation and one impact. Classify them as beneficial or harmful and explain. Remember that effects are subjective and can be seen as beneficial or harmful depending on the purpose. There is no single “right” answer, so this is graded based on how clear your explanation is.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A relatively recent development in computers is quantum computing, where qubits are used as its unit of information. Taking advantage of quantum mechanics, quantum computers are much faster and more effective, at especially calculations, than regular supercomputers, which have implications in fields where there are many variables and unknowns.</li>
    <li>January 1st, 1983 is considered the birthday of the Internet, and as you all can guess, the Internet connected all computer networks across the globe.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider this hypothetical scenario. 15 years from now, Team WRONG is planning to launch a new virtual reality system to be streamline gaming and make the experience more immersive. The team has planned for the beneficial effects of attracting more people into gaming and helping people relieve their stress, and for the harmful effects of making the addiction issue worse.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is one potential unintended effect and why can it lead to it? Is this effect beneficial or harmful and why?</li>
  </ul>
