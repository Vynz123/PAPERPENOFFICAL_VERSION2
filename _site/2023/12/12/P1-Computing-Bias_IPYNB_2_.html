<p><strong>Bias</strong>: prejudice in favor of or against a thing, person, or group</p>

<h2 id="what-is-computer-bias">What is “computer bias”?</h2>
<p>The existence of prejudiced outcomes in the decisions or predictions made by computer systems/algorithms. Bias can be implemented into algorithms because of human biases being intentionally inserted or because of the data utilized being biased.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit Data:</strong>
Information directly provided by user.</p>

<p><strong>Implicit Data:</strong>
Infomration that can inferred from explicit data.</p>

<p>Based on either explicit/implicit data that has been used to train an algorithm, whether intentionally introduced or during the process of training data generation, bias can be created.</p>

<p>A notable example of this is seen in Netflix, where there are is a human factor that drives bias: Netflix exclusives are placed ahead (a show that is a Netflix exclusive means that users will be more likely to stay with Netflix). The bias in this case is Netflix’s prioritzation towards Netflix-produced shows.</p>

<h1 id="reducing-bias">Reducing Bias</h1>
<p>Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases. Softwares need to be unbiased, consider all everything, and reject human bias.</p>

<p>Things to consider when developing programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are potential sources of bias?</li>
  <li>Is your program enhancing or intentionally excluding?</li>
  <li>Are you receiving feedback from a widespread group of people?</li>
  <li>How could people who differ from you use your developments?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="types-of-bias-in-software-development">Types of Bias in Software Development</h1>
<p>Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.</p>

<p>It can be intentional or unintentional. Some software development are made for a certain market and ensure that people of certain places or demographics can use them easily. However, this doesn’t mean that they are trying to exclude.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p><strong>Intentional</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Games could be geared towards a certain age range (Talking Tom vs Valorant)
    <ul>
      <li>Game concepts</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>Visuals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>WeChat and KakaoTalk
    <ul>
      <li>Almost everyone in China uses WeChat</li>
      <li>KakaoTalk is the Korean version</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unintentional</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social media, Facebook vs. instagram</li>
</ul>
