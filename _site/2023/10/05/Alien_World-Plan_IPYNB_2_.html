<p>Over my Computer Science years I have found that it is a lot more interesting to code if you start with something fun.   Loops are kind of boring, but if you add animation, alien planet, and monkeys what is not to like.</p>

<h3 id="initial-concepts">Initial concepts:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Mr M (Product Owner, Scrum Master)
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce basic concepts to non coder, even younger children</li>
      <li>Make game easy, instead of start over continue but require more events for success</li>
      <li>Use features like collision, role play, gravity, squish to help in countdown</li>
      <li>Try to integrate coding concepts like Object Oriented Programming,into game</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>Quinn. Ideas from CSA friend Quinn
  In a distant galaxy, far, far away, there was a world known as “Codeonia.” In this realm, software engineers and programmers lived harmoniously, creating and coding various applications for the universe. Among the inhabitants of Codeonia was Java the Hut, a wise and experienced programmer known for his mastery of programming languages.
  One day, a group of mischievous bugs and glitches threatened to plunge Codeonia into chaos. These digital nuisances were led by Darth Compiler, a formidable dark coder who sought to corrupt the code of the entire galaxy.</p>

<h2 id="outline-of-scenes">Outline of Scenes</h2>

<p>Scene Design will be an ongoing process, as we enhance game play it is expected to have new ideas.  By splitting game up into parts it provides unique development opportunities to each individual.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Game Intro (Map design of Game)</li>
  <li>Identity and Force/Power Design</li>
  <li>Game Play, start with different options  Dog Sprite, Monkey Sprite, Mario Sprite</li>
  <li>Note, each level could start with Character or Background and build up as code progresses</li>
</ol>

    <ul>
      <li>platform</li>

<h3 id="game-code-and-oop">Game Code and OOP</h3>
<p>Most game code you find on the internet is built in a single file.  However, once you reach a certain amount of complexity this becomes difficult to manage.  Thus, this project is broken into objects.</p>

<p>In the early days of this project, it was easy to see repetition in code (draw() and update()) as well as grouping of attributes and classes using “isa” and “hasa” relationships.  This picture is a talking point.  A more active verion of this picture is the “classDiagram.drawio” in this repository.</p>

<p><img src="/teacher_portfolio/images/draw_io_example.png" alt="drawio classes" /></p>

<h3 id="migrating-to-oop---background">Migrating to OOP - Background</h3>

<p>To migrate to this project it can begin by changingthe background to your preference.  This code starts in index.htmol and simply change the image in the frontmatter.</p>

<p>Swap beteen alien_planet.jpg and alien_plant2.jpg</p>

<ul>
  <li>index.html simply change yml to point to your preference</li>
</ul>

<p>Rework ADJUST in Background.js to crop out imperfections in image</p>

<ul>
  <li>assets/js/alienWorld/Background.js change adjust if you want to reduce height of image</li>
