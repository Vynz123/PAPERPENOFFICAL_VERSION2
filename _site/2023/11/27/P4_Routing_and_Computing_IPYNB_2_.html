<h1 id="42-routing-fault-tolerance">4.2 Routing (Fault Tolerance)</h1>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.1</mark> The Internet has been engineered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.2</mark> <font color="#FFA500">Redundancy</font> is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.3</mark> One way to accomplish <font color="#FFA500">network redundancy</font> is by having more than one path between any two connected devices.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.4</mark> If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.5</mark> When a system can support failures and still continue to function, it is called <font color="#FFA500">fault-tolerant</font>. This is important because elements of complex systems fail at unexpected times, often in groups, and fault tolerance allows users to continue to use the network.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.6</mark> Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance.</p>

<p><mark>CSN-1.E.7</mark> The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</p>

<h2 id="computer-tasks">Computer Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A computer needs to handle many tasks as it operates:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <font color="#FFA500">System Tasks</font>
        <p>: the operating system has dozens of tasks, like scheduling what it 
 will be doing next, managing hardware, working with the network, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <font color="#FFA500">User Tasks</font>
        <p>: executing programs that the user has selected, such as running MS 
 Excel and MS Word, or computer games</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tasks need to be scheduled by the operating system. Balance tasks so all CPUs are being
used evenly and fully.</li>
  <li>Running tasks can be done sequentially, in parallel, and be distributed to other computers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sequential-computing">Sequential Computing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#FFA500">Sequential Computing</font>
    <p>: Tasks are done one after another. It is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The computer works tasks A, B, C, … one at a time.</li>
  <li>Why do this?
    <ul>
      <li>It has <font color="#FFA500">limited hardware</font>: It only has one CPU (older hardware)</li>
      <li>Its <font color="#FFA500">tasks are dependent</font>: Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B, so the needed order is A, B, and finally C.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Execution Time: Sequential Operations add up all the individual task execution times.</li>
  <li>Example:
    <ul>
      <li>Task A takes 50 ms</li>
      <li>Task B takes 40 ms</li>
      <li>Task C takes 35 ms</li>
      <li>Total processing time is 50 ms + 40 ms + 35 ms = 125 ms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of sequential computing as items one at a time on a conveyor belt.</p>

    <p><img src="../images/SequentialComputing.png" alt="Sequential Computing" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parallel-computing">Parallel Computing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#FFA500">Parallel Computing</font>
    <p>: A computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>schedules tasks to be executed at the same time</li>
      <li>normally done on the same computer</li>
      <li>consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes to perform the same set task.</li>
  <li>Why Parallel Computing?
    <ul>
      <li>
        <font color="#FFA500">Hardware Driven</font>
        <p>: New hardware has several processors in one system, called cores. 1 CPU can have 64+ cores. Graphic cards for gaming can have thousands of cores.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Faster Operations: Supercomputers link hundreds of CPUs together to work the same problem.</li>
      <li>
        <font color="#FFA500"> Data Driven</font>
        <p>: A lot of data can be processed the same way (video gaming), called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)</p>
      </li>
      <li>Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Execution Time:
    <ul>
      <li>Time equals the longest time taken on any given processor,</li>
      <li>A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.</li>
      <li>Parallel processing works best when the tasks are independent from each other– they don’t depend on each other’s answers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Example:
    <ul>
      <li>Core 1: Task A takes 45 ms</li>
      <li>Core 2: Task B takes 50 ms</li>
      <li>Core 3: Task C takes 25 ms; Task D takes 30 ms</li>
      <li>Core 4: Task E takes 40 ms</li>
      <li>Total time needed: 55 ms (Core 3 with Tasks C and D in sequence)</li>

What is the minimum amount of time (approximate) to execute all three processes when the two processors are run in parallel?

<h2 id="speedup-time">Speedup Time</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <font color="#FFA500">“speedup” of a parallel solution</font> is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel.
    <ul>
      <li>Sequential Total processing time is 50 ms + 40 ms + 35 ms = 125 ms</li>
      <li>Parallel Total time needed = 75 ms</li>

  </li>

<p><em><mark>NOTE</mark>: When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still restricted by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer significantly increase efficiency.</em></p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#FFA500">Distributed Computing</font>
    <p>: the sending of tasks from one computer to one or more others. It is a model in which multiple devices are used to run a program.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>can mix sequential and parallel computing, based on how it sends out tasks to other computers to work</li>
      <li>allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or storage needs involved</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Google Web Search: you ask for a search, and Google sends the request to its thousand of servers in the background.</li>
      <li>Web Services: standards on how computers can ask for task execution over the web. This includes protocols like SOAP, RSS, REST, etc.</li>
