<h2 id="beneficial-and-harmful-effects-of-technological-innovations">Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Technological Innovations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People are the driving force behind creating computing innovations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovations are crafted with specific goals in mind. But they can have unforeseen consequences, both positive and negative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A creator cant predict all the things that can be done with their innovation as there are so many things that could be done and as technology evolves, new uses are made</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning Opportunities: Many video games are designed to be educational and can enhance cognitive skills such as problem-solving, strategic thinking, and hand-eye coordination. Some games even incorporate historical or scientific elements, providing players with additional knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creativity: Video games often stimulate creativity and imagination. Games with open-world exploration or creative building elements encourage players to think outside the box and express themselves in unique ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community Building: Both video games and social media can foster a sense of community. Gamers often form online communities where they share tips, strategies, and experiences. Social media also allows people with common interests to connect and form communities.</p>

<h2 id="mitigating-risksresponsiblity">Mitigating Risks/Responsiblity</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Targeted advertising, machine learning, and data mining are all good exampels of how unintended uses can have both positive and negative effecs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though it is impossible to predict all possibilities, a responsible programmer’s goal it to forsee and prevent any unintended/negative uses and effects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rapid sharing of a program can lead to events outside the creators control</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Finding a balance between innovation and responsibility is important</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programmers shape the impact of their creations on society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unintended uses of innovations may potentiallyhave harmful impacts on society</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While negative effects could occur, Innovations often bring unintended benefits by helping advance the current states of technology.</p>
